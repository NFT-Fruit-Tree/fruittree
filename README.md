# 🏗 Scaffold-ETH

> everything you need to build on Ethereum! 🚀

🧪 Quickly experiment with Solidity using a frontend that adapts to your smart contract:

🎛 Any web3 dev environment is complex, that's why 🏗 Scaffold-ETH comes with everything you need, already working together:

- Hardhat for your local blockchain, deploying, and testing smart contracts.
- React for building a frontend, using many useful pre-made components and hooks.
- Ant for your UI. (You can easily changed to another library you prefer)
- Surge / S3 / IPFS for publishing your app.
- Tenderly / The Graph / Etherscan / Infura / Blocknative for infrastructure.
- Support for L2 / Sidechains like Optimism and Arbitrum.

# 🏄‍♂️ Quick Start

Prerequisites: [Node](https://nodejs.org/dist/latest-v12.x/) plus [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

> clone/fork 🏗 scaffold-eth:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git
```

> install and start your 👷‍ Hardhat chain: 

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn install
yarn chain
```

> in a second terminal window, start your 📱 frontend:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn start
```

> in a third terminal window, 🛰 deploy your contract:

```bash
cd scaffold-eth
yarn deploy
```

You should now have a local blockchain, with `YourContract.sol` deployed, and your app running on https://localhost:3000.

# üèó scaffold-eth - üå≤ Merkle Mint NFTs

> Use a Merkle tree of possible artworks and then submit a proof it is valid to mint.

Deployer pays around (0.283719 ETH ~$500 at todays gas and price) for the initial contract but then NFTs are only minted once a buyer wants them. (The buyer of the NFT pays the gas to mint. ~$55)

## About The Project

This branch uses the concept of [merkel root](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/merkle-root-cryptocurrency.asp#:~:text=A%20Merkle%20root%20is%20a,whole%2C%20undamaged%2C%20and%20unaltered.) to verify on chain NFT minting. So insteead of pushing all verfied NFT hashes on-chain which would be quite expensive we generate a merkel root by modifying [these](https://github.com/Uniswap/merkle-distributor/tree/master/src) scripts to make our life easier.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You have to know what is an ERC721 standard and what is NFT. Please refer to [this](http://erc721.org/) and [this](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/erc721) for more information if you are not familiar with these terms.

### Installation

Let's start our environment for tinkering and exploring how NFT auction would work.

1. Clone the repo first
```sh
git clone https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth.git buyer-mints-nft
```

2. Install dependencies
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Start local chain ina different terminal
```bash
yarn chain
```

3. Start your React frontend
```bash
yarn start
```

4. Deploy your smart contracts to a local blockchain
```bash
yarn deploy
```

## Smart contracts

Let's navigate to `packages/hardhat/contracts` folder and check out what contracts we have there.

We use a couple of contracts in this dApp.

### MerkleTreeContract.sol

All the logic that verifies minting a particular NFT sits here.
When you run `yarn deploy` a merkel root is generated and then passed in this contracts constructor while deploying.


`claim` is the main function which a buyer can call and mint a particular nft.
``` solidity
function claim(uint256 index, string calldata tokenURI, bytes32[] calldata merkleProof)
```
These are the arguments passed while sending the transaction, the merkel prrof and index are generated for each NFT at the time of the proof, navigate through this [file](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/blob/merkle-root-buyer-mints/packages/hardhat/scripts/deploy.js) for more info.

``` solidity
require(MerkleProof.verify(merkleProof, merkleRoot, node), 'MerkleDistributor: Invalid proof.');
```
This is the line where the proof verification takes place so if any NFT which was not a part of the merkel root generation is minted the transaction will revert.

If the proof validates the NFT is then minted to the buyer.


## Practice

When you navigate to the react app on your browser you'll see the NFT's for which the merkel root was generated

üí¶ Use the faucet wallet icon in the bottom left of the frontend to give your address **$1000** in testnet ETH.

üé´ Try to "Mint" an NFT:

and voil√† you see your address as the owner after on-chain verification.
